In my opinion, it is necesarry to adopt machine learning and data analysis to provide recommendations for them to decide or purchase a suitable and reasonably priced real estate in Melbourne. \\\nTo solve this business problem, we are going to cluster Melbourne neighborhoods in order to recommend venues and the current average price of real estate where homebuyers can make a real estate investment. We will recommend profitable venues based on amenities and essential facilities surrounding such venues i.e. elementary schools, high schools, hospitals & grocery stores."
